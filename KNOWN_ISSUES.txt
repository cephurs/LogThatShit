The following are known issues that are NOT fixed: 

ISSUE:	Does not work on Windows 98 

FIX:	I am not 100% sure but I did NOT test it out on anything other 
		than Windows XP SP1 and SP2. I will do so eventually and fix 
		any problems that may occur on 9X. 

ISSUE: 	If the victim logs into a new Windows account, the log 
		file will display 'Logging started @ ... for user NewUser' 
		because Explorer.exe restarts for the new user. The problem 
		is when the user switches back to his former account, it will 
		still be running the same instance of Explorer.exe. Windows does 
		NOT restart it. So when the user logs back into his previous 
		account, you will not know, but the keys will still get logged. 

FIX:	Make the log file names user specific. Instead of keys.log, make 
		the log file username_keys.log 


ISSUE: 	Uploading a non-EXE file to the FTP and naming it the EXEC name 
		you configured in the INI file will not cause an error. Even 
		though a non-EXE can not be executed via CreateProcess(). 

FIX:	Only upload EXE files to the FTP as the EXEC value. If you 
		HAVE to display a JPG or play an mp3 in the default viewer or 
		player associated with the Victim's box, use the SHELL variable. 
		(Which is currently not implemented?)
